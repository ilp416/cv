# About
Ilya Levaleuski-Peravozchykau. 35 years old. Brest Belarus.  
I find an interesting project useful for people. I won't like to work for betting services or for stock exchange.
I prefer to work for 4-6 hours per day, because I want some time for personal projects and for trainings.
I'm not ready to relocation at nearest time, but I like short business trips (about 1 week).
I practice creative approach all the time in work and live.
I think what most important thing in developement is understanding of task and thinking about decision: ideal case is solve the task without any line of code.
