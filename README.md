# About
Ilya Levaleuski-Peravozchykau. 33 years old. Brest Belarus. 
I find a job for 4-6 hours per day. Not a full workday because I'm a sportsman and want more time for trainings.

I practice creative approach all the time in work and live.
I think what most important thing in developement is understanding of task and thinking about decision: ideal case is solve the task without any line of code.
